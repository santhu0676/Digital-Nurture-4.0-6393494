# Office Space Rental App (React Lab)

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Digital Nurture 4.0 program** to demonstrate JSX fundamentals and React component creation. The application displays a catalog of available office spaces with details including name, location, and monthly rental rates.

## Key Learning Outcomes

Through this hands-on laboratory exercise, several core React concepts were implemented:

- **JSX Syntax Implementation:** Integration of HTML-like syntax within JavaScript components for streamlined UI development.

- **Component Architecture:** Single component application structure using the main `App` component.

- **JavaScript Expression Embedding:** Utilization of curly braces `{}` for dynamic content rendering including office properties and rental values.

- **Array Mapping for Dynamic Rendering:** Implementation of `.map()` method to iterate through office data arrays and generate listing elements programmatically.

- **Conditional Styling Logic:** Application of ternary operators within `style` attributes to conditionally format rental prices (red for amounts â‰¤ Rs. 60,000, green for higher amounts).

## Implementation Code

```jsx
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  const officeList = [
    { Name: "DBS", Rent: 50000, Address: "Chennai" },
    { Name: "WeWork", Rent: 75000, Address: "Mumbai" },
    { Name: "Regus", Rent: 58000, Address: "Bangalore" },
  ];

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Office Space, at Affordable Range</h1>

        width="25%"
        height="25%"
        alt="Office Space"
      />

      {officeList.map((office, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          <h2>Name: {office.Name}</h2>
          <h3 style={{ color: office.Rent <= 60000 ? "red" : "green" }}>
            Rent: Rs. {office.Rent}
          </h3>
          <h3>Address: {office.Address}</h3>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
